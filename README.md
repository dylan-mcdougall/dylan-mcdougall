### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer based in CA but want to eventually be able to travel everywhere I can while I work. I'm intending to work my way into AI and eventually robotics. I used to be big into games to the point where I had aspirations to go pro and even played and coached at the amateur level. At any given point you can safely assume I'm grinding away at some form of growth :triumph: :muscle:
